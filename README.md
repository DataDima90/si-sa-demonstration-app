## Goal of this project

The goal was to implement the following logic

- A visitor can see multiple free and premium E-Books
- A visitor can read an E-Book and track the reading progress
- A visitor sees a payment wall for a premium E-Books
- An analytics event should be tracked when the visitor clicks on the purchase button.

- Additionally, describe how a potential integration of video content and a selfservice
area for our business customers can look like (uploading and managing
their own content). How would your architecture look overall?

In addition:
- how I approach such a task in general
- on what criteria I base my decisions
- how I construct a solution
